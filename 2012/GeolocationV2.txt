title: Geolocation V2 removed from Gecko
date: 2013-03-08



I implemented the W3C Geolocation API V2 specification ahead
of the other browsers. In this API, web sites can not only
request a latitude and longitude but also request a physical
mailing address. It does this by ‘geocoding’ the latitude
and longitude pair using a third party service.  These
services typically cost a lot.  On the desktop, I disabled
this feature after a few months of it live.  After the
removal, I did not receive any emails that things ‘broke’.
Hence, I believe there is little demand for V2.

I am going to remove support for V2 in Mozilla.  In the
future, if there is a demand, I think the right approach is
to expose geocoding to the web as a separate API.  Stay Tuned.
