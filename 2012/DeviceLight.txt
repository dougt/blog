title: Device Light Sensor
date: 2012-03-26

Similar to proximity, Many devices also have light sensors
embedded in them. To expose this to web content we should
just use DOM Events similar to that of Device Motion and
Device Orientation. A developer simply has to register an
event listener:

      window.addEventListener("devicelight", callback, true);

The callback’s parameters include:

    value – the current ambient light level in SI lux units


    function callback(a) {
             var d = document.getElementById("d");
             d.innerHTML = "<p> Current Value " + a.value
    }

Like Device Proximity, the sensor will be turned on when the
first listener is added. And, of course, the sensor will be
turned off when the last event listener is removed.

This work is being tracked in this [bug][]. Sample

I hope to get this in for Firefox 14 or 15, and of course,
B2G.
