title: Device Proximity
date: 2012-03-22

Many devices have proximity sensors embedded in them.  To
expose this to web content we should just use DOM Events
similar to that of Device Motion and Device Orientation.  A
developer simply has to register an event listener:


    window.addEventListener("deviceproximity", callback, true);

The callback’s parameters include:

    value – the current distance to the proximity sensor in cm.
    min – the minimum value that the sensor and report. Usually zero.
    max – the maximum value that the sensor can report.


    function callback(a) {
             var d = document.getElementById("d");
             d.innerHTML = "<p> Current Value " + a.value + "<p> Max = " + 
             a.max +  "<p> Min = " + a.min
    }

Like Device Motion and Device Orientation, the sensor will
be turned on when the first listener is added.  And, of
course, the sensor will be turned off when the last event
listener is removed.

This work is being tracked in bugzilla bug 738131.  Sample

I hope to get this in for Firefox 14 or 15, and of course,
B2G.
