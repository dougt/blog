title: Geolocation Address
date: 2009-07-20

Last week, I pushed a change that will enable tomorrow’s
trunk Firefox builds (Minefield) to access user-readable
position information.

For example, instead only being able to work with:

    37.3882005, -122.0834553

You can see the physical address as:

    650 Castro St, Mountain View, California, 94041, US

This should help aide the many people that already know
their physical address in familiar terms.

To access address elements, you simply do what you have been
doing.Â  The only modification is to test to see if there is
an address associated with the position, and if so, access
it:

        navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(successCallback)
        function successCallback(position)
        {
            if (position.address)
                    alert(position.address.postalCode);
                    }

Other fields on the address object are:

      address.streetNumber
      address.street
      address.premises
      address.city
      address.region
      address.county
      address.countryCode
      address.postalCode

Please let me know what you think.
