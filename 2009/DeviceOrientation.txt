title: Device Orientation
date: 2009-03-30

I have a proposal for exposing device orientation in the
browser. It is a pretty simple api that allows you to
monitor motion changes from Javascript.

For example:

    navigator.orientation.watchOrientation(draw);
    function draw(o) {
             // o.x, o.y, o.z
    }


o in function draw is a vector in three dimensional space in
meters / (seconds^2) units.

This allows you to do some revolutionary stuff on the
web. This is a simple test web page that moves a ball around
a web page. I am just loading this web page directly with
XUL Runner on Windows Mobile Professional 6.

This only supports exists on HTC devices but i do expect
other devices that have accelerometers to have
implementations.

I am tracking this feature in bug 485943. Please check it
out and let me know what you think.
