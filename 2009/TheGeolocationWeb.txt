Today, when you go to maps.google.com, you will notice
something new:

That little button between the map control and the
street view man, when pressed, will enable geolocation for
maps.

Other sites also have started adopting geolocation. Flickr
has created a maps page that has a Find my location button
that uses geolocation to position you and then show you
pictures from your area:

What other cool sites have you seen?
