title: MouseEvent pressure property
date: 2008-05-05



I added a new attribute on the MouseEvent to expose the
amount of pressure is being applied to a touch screen.

The video shows me pressing a pen then my finger on the
touch screen.Â  The value on screen is a number between 0
and 1; zero indicating no pressure and one indicating alot
of pressure.Â  Sorry about the quality.

ou could imagine building a web painting application that
varies the thickness of a line based on how hard you press,
or the Fennec browser app could vary the speed of the scroll
based on how hard the user presses on the scroll area.

Before this makes it into the project, there are a bunch of
unanswered questions in the bug.Â  Mostly questions relate
to how we expose this property in the DOM, and how to gather
this pressure information from the platforms.
