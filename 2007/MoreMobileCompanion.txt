title: More on the Mobile Companion
date: 2007-01-23

At the last Firefox Submit, we discussed this idea called
the [Mobile Companion][] in which we could address some of the
immediate needs of Firefox uses. Some of the use cases
discussed could be summarized as “being able to use the
mobile phone as an endpoint in Firefox’s data
brokering”. Mitchell, [Read/Write Web][], and Alex spoke a bit
about this idea that Firefox could be used as the thing that
can manage all of your “metadata” in the browser.

The targeted phone is much lower end than what Minimo
required. We are thinking just about any phone that can run
Java should be able to use what we build.
Some use cases include
1) You browser upon calendar data on the web, you should be
able to get that data to your phone. Either to some built in
calendar on the phone, or send an SMS to the phone as a
reminder, etc.
2) You are on a map site and you want to get the directions
to your phone, it should be as easy as sending an SMS (see
sendtophone addon by google).
3) You have selected to bookmark a microsummary
(LiveTitles), you should have an option to get the LiveTitle
updates to your phone even when Firefox is closed.
4) You should be able to browse your images in Firefox, and
have the ability to push (and possibility convert to the
correct format) an image to your phone.
If you have ideas about other use cases, feel free to update
the [wiki][].
