title: Protecting against passive personalization
date: 2006-08-25

Have you see this:

This site lets you rate users by how interesting their
queries were. I would stay away from any that are marked,
'Masterpiece'. People who's id's are marked in such a way
probably need professional help. seriously. Just to give you
a taste: User [2281868][] is a person who believes that demons
live in the apartment above him. His actually search query
was how destroy [demons][] that live in apt above.

Just troll around a bit. it is somewhat like a mystery you
need to piece together. For example, user [789586][] plays world
of warcraft, lives in Halifax, and is going to visit New
York with is new verizon phone. Am I sure about this? i do
not know, but I would bet I am pretty close.

When I was at AOL/Netscape, there was a really smart guy
talking about this concept of passive personalization (bonus
points if you know who I am talking about). The idea is that
over time you find out ALOT about what a person likes and
doesn't like by closely watching what they do in a
system. Advertisers love this as they can target an ad
directly to the demographic they are interested in. For
example, User [2281868][] would see ads depression medication,
and user user [789586][] might get ads on gold farming. This
seams nice as you are not going to ads that are completely
out of your demographic. However, it is terrible that you
have no control over this - there is no user control to
reset this data or erase it.

What do we, the average person, do about it? Here are a
few tips.

1) Clear your cookies. At shutdown have Firefox purge all of
your cookies. If you do not know how to do this, ask
someone.

2) Use a dynamic ip. some ISPs have long leases. make sure
that renew your IP as often as you can.

3) Use anonymizer or some other tunneling software that
masks who you are.

4) Someone should write a Firefox extension to send dummy
queries to your default search engine to mix things
up. Adding noise is a good thing. Maybe there already is
one, if not put one up and I will buy you lunch even if I
have to mail it to you. :-)

If you have more, please share.
