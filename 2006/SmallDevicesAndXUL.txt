title: small devices and libxul without xul.
date: 2006-01-13



Benjamin has been doing some great work pushing the xul
embedding story with xulrunner. There has been some
confusion what this means for small devices, at least, i
have gotten several mails and IM's regarding this.

Here is the summary:

1) people working on mozilla guts ([summarized][] by benjamin)
are worried about the hundreds of options that configure.in
gives you. There is a non-zero cost to having these sort of
options, etc. Plus, some of these options give you the power
to fragment what sort of web api support you get. This
pisses off content developers because they can't figure out
what a browser supports based on their UA string.

2) After a "spirited" debate, the decision was made by
Brendan Eich that we will not drop no-XUL support. This was
a smart decision. :-)

3) The gtk widget that wraps up gecko internals will use the
libxul library. libxul is this new library that wraps up all
of the gecko guts into an easy to use package.

4) libxul will have an option to not include xul. It is a
terrible name, that should get fixed with a Makefile change.

5) 3 suppported tiers will be created, and we will encourage
embedders to move to one of these options. Each of these 3
options will be using the libxul library (with or without
xul) If you want changes in these tiers, send mail / file
bugs.
