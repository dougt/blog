title: Coolkey in Redhat FC6
date: 2006-10-13

Looks like the key/token management stuff I worked on at AOL
that was acquired by RedHat is public. It looks like the
license blocked was chopped off and replaced with a standard
GNU General Public License and the class names have been
renamed.

Apparently this stuff is default in FC6. Congrats to
Wan-Teh, Bob, Bob, and the rest of the team. ;-)
