title: Skyhook Wireless Cagematch!
date: 2006-09-12

I wrote an extension against the Skyhook Wireless API. It
was selected as one of the finalists of their "Wi-Fi Cage
Match" contests. Cool!

The summary is:

The location-awareness Firefox / Minimo extension, developed
by a third party developer, integrates auto-location
determination into the Firefox/Minimo browser turning it
into a platform for various location-based services. As a
result, content accessed or viewed within the browser is
specifically and dynamically changed based on the user's
location. For example, a movie directory site viewed in the
Firefox/Minimo browser will immediately show only local
movies without having you enter a zip code, or an airline's
webpage might notice that you are in a terminal and return
to you the arrival/departure data without you having to tap
your way through nested links.

The specific demo I included was a Google Maps mashup which
I mentioned here before.
