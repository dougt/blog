title: Gestural Phone Prototype

[Alec][] Saunders wrote a bit on what he saw at FTRD. As I
understand the demo, it is written using a scriptable NPAPI
plugin. It also is using Minimo 0.08. (it is not using
java).

It is great to see innovation like this happen. I think Open
Source allows this to happen a bit quicker than if a closed
source solution was used. No one really had to go out and
sign some kind of agreement to license source code or
anything silly like that. FTRD simply was able to plug in
and modify the application to test out new idea. As it
turned out, the scriptable NPAPI worked fine for their
needs.

There are other areas where there just isn't a good way to
plugin without getting your hands dirty and modifying the
guts of the source code. One example that comes to mind is
DCI. FT has been involved in the mobile standards
process. Brad Lassey, a senior research scientist at FTRD
Boston told me, its [minimo] really opened up a bunch of
cool projects for us.

Great work guys!
