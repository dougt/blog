title: Minimo Road Ahead
date: 2006-12-18

As you might have noticed, I have not been spending alot of
time on Minimo recently, but instead I have been doing alot
of thinking about Minimo's potential and the many issues
that must be overcome (both on the business side as well as
on the technical side). The summary is that there are lots
of browser in the space, the market is tightly control by
cellular operators, and the end users aren't using the
browser. This will change, but not for a few years.

At the Firefox Summit, we had a brainstorming session that
exposed some ideas that would help improve the lives of
Firefox users that have mobile phones without having to
build a full browser for the mobile handset. Things that we
could do in a few months, rather than many years. Over the
next few months, I will continue flushing out some of these
ideas.

Minimo will continue to live as a open source project under
mozilla.org but I will have quite limited time to hack on
it. If you are interested in stepping up, drop me mail.
