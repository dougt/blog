Some of the unsung heros of our community are those brave
embedders that took the mozilla code and massaged it into
their own applications. This isn't a trival task that you
can throw just anyone at.

A friend of mine, Callum Prentice and I worked together over
the last few months to help embed Mozilla Technologies into
SecondLife. He put together an awesome embedding example
known as [uBrowser][] which shows some of the progress he has made.
