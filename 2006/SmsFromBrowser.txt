title: Sending SMS's from Minimo
date: 2006-04-06


I added the abilty to send SMS's in Minimo 014 for CE. We
haven't really exposed this feature in any meaningful way
yet, but the functionality exists. To get started, here is a
snippet of code. Keep in mind that using this feature in web
content requires UniversalXPConnect permissions (hence not
ready in any way for prime time). The number has to be in
international format.
