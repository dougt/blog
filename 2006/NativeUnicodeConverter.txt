title: Native Unicode Converter
date: 2006-04-03


I wrote a native Unicode converter for windows ce which also
works on Windows 32. This allows us to remove alot of
code+data from firefox (on ARM i saved .67MB). This might be
something we could enable on the trunk since we have dropped
Windows 98 support. If you have time, i would love for you
to evaluate it. To create a build, just add this like to
your mozconfig:

     ac_add_options --enable-native-uconv

The code for this converter lives here:
