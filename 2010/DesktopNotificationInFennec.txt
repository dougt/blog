title: Desktop Notifications in Fennec

Just a quick update. I implemented Desktop Notifications in
Mozilla. The first product that will use this will be
Fennec, or Firefox for mobile. The work is based on and is a
subset of the w3c draft specification. For now, the API is
Mozilla specific and is accessible via
navigator.mozNotification.

When building this API, I was very minimal and only wanted
attributes that would be used by everyone. You can find some
simple examples here.

Please give it a try, and let me know what you think. You
can this it out in any of the latest nightly builds of
Fennec.

On OSs that do not have a native notification system, you
will see something like:

On Android, you will see something like:

![Android style desktop notification](2010/DesktopNotificationsAndroid.png)

Fair to note here, that because android doesn’t have a way
to change the graphic in the notification area, you’ll
always get the Fennec/Firefox icon. If you know a
workaround, do tell!
